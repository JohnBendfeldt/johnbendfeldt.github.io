			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<br>
			<img src="assets/images/myface.jpg" id="face">
			<p>I was born in Tanzania when my family was working overseas. We moved back to the States when I was almost 6 years old. I lived in Virginia until two years ago when my lovely wife, Andi, and I moved here to Austin, TX. We were drawn to the warm weather and wanted a to find a place to settle down. We love living in Austin with our four cats.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I spent over four years in management with Domino's in Virginia. I have experience managing a staff of up to 30 team members. I helped maintain 5 star operations while marketing to maintain consistent sales growth. After working for over a year in management with DOmino’s here I realized I wanted to do something more. I loved the work I did but wanted to find a career where I could build and create more.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I was looking for a way to express myself creatively. I stepped down as a manager at Domino’s at the beginning of 2017 and enrolled in the Full-Stack Coding Boot Camp at UT Austin. My dream is to be a full-stack web developer. I enjoy working with a team to help create satisfied customers. While I am great with a team I am also self-motivated and can work alone to find solutions to challenges that arise.</p>
